5 videos | 3 hours | B0 playlist

Stressed, I am stressed. The first video was fun, if not a bit overwhelming at the beginning. Subsequent videos felt like a baragge of unfamiliar sounds and my brain was not having a good time trying to parse them. There were a few words I know (pom, chan, kruu, gin, puu-chai, puu-ying, bpen) but aside from those it was hard differentiating between the ends and begginings of words. 

This feels vastly different than Dreaming Spanish. Most likely because I've internalized Spanish to some degree by childhood exposure (weekly language classes going over the same 20 vocab words for 10 years), the amount of cognates etc. I think learning an Asian language through comprehensible input will be the true test of the method for me. 

My goal is to finish the B0 playlist in a week. There are 20 - 21 hours total so it feels doable. The B0 playlist is comprised of videos that are almost all above 30 minutes each. Thankfully, the following B1 playlist has videos that are roughly half the length. I assume that will help with focusing. Currently it feels quite difficult to keep focused - regardless of how charming Kruu Ae and Kruu Ying are. They're both delightful and I imagine they would be wonderful to experience in a classroom setting that naturally demands a bit more attention.
